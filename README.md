# CuteText Module

This is a text converter. Normal text to cute text converter. I will teach you cutetext. If you will use time, use cutetime in CuteText. If change your decide, use cuteprint in CuteText.

CuteText documentation

`cuteprint()` It only takes arguments to convert.

`cutetime()` It takes few arguments. These : `"now"`,`"timestamp"`,`"fromtimestamp"`,`"ctime"`. 

Example : `cutetime("now")`, It's very simple.

I know this module very simple and easy. I'm just new and trying to improve myself. Sorry, I used translation for some words.


It is still in development.
